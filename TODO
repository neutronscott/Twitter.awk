	* CREATE CONF FILE for TOKENS and SAVE NEW ONES there
	  "use openssl" // "use wchartable"
	* test "printf c | od", use it instead of WCHAR table [conf option]
	* need function to read_header_status(), return HTTP status code.
	  stop at \n\n
	* put oauth_header() in http_make_cmd ?
	* create table for conv_hex2bin(conv_str2hex(s)) ? can't with WCHAR eh?
	  maybe table ASCII and call conv_hex2bin(conv_str2hex()) is missing
	* put hex comments in sha1sum *shrug*
	* fix that padding loop in sha1sum heh.
	* replace curl with openssl client? :o
