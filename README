Twitter.awk
July 2011. Scott Nicholas.

When I learn a new language I usually write an IRC bot. I did that.
Then I realized Twitter streaming API. That'd allow real-time interface
like IRC.

The crazy part was doing HMAC-SHA1 myself in nawk. gawk has bitwise functions,
nawk does not. Thus, I made functions to operate on binary strings. :D
